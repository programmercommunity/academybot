# Todo list for bots

Please read `CONTRIBUTORS.MD` first, thanks ✨!

## Command List

(why not arabic commands)

- #priv, #private, #dm, #DM:
  - sends a private message to the user
  - the message is his information and will have buttons to edit, update, whatever..
- #points
  - sends the number of points in arabic
- #profile, #id, #me
  - sends a summary about the user
- #leader, #leaderboard, #top
  - sends the points leaderboard

Only on private:

- #update
  - follows up with a message, what do you want to update, then updates
- #chpass, #cpas, #change_password
  - two options, directly change the pass, or verify that the user is himself, maybe by sending a token to an admin then the admin will verify if he's him or not, and give him the token...
- #handle
  - this command will return a message with two buttons, reset and change the handle
  - handles are automatically setted if there's a username in telegram

## Feats

The first version of the bot must have:

- most basic profile (without the password)
- points system

### Initial Features

- [ ]  Define commands: Use `#` for commands but ensure they don’t conflict with hashtags in group messages.
- [ ]  Name the bot: Assign a funny and unique name (must not start with "ABU").

### Profiling Users

- [ ]  Users may specify the language they want to use with the bot (ar/en)
- [ ]  Create profiles: Automatically generate a profile for every member in the group.
- [ ]  Populate profiles: Include fields like name, phone, email, age, bio, and other fillable data. (every possible collectable BIT of info)
- [ ]  Allow profile updates: Enable users to update their profile data via private messages with the bot.
- [ ]  Add password field: Include a password field in profiles for potential future use.
- [ ]  Implement points system: Track points for each user.
- [ ]  Increment message points: Add +1 point for every message a user sends.
- [ ]  Reward solutions: Add +5 or +10 points when a user provides a valid solution.
- [ ]  Detect solutions: Implement a feature to recognize solutions via a reply using `#solution`.
- [ ]  Allow admin actions: Enable admins to manually add points to users.
- [ ]  Promote users: Automatically promote users to admin when they reach a specified point threshold.
- [ ]  Sync existing messages: Calculate and add points for all past messages in the database. (maybe manually)

### Referral System

- [ ] implement a referred by and referredMembers data.
- [ ] make a url redirector on the same app that updates those data
- [ ] use telegram join url (dunno how)
- [ ] on each join, ask the joined one to mention the refferd
- [ ] it's unchangeable

### Interact with GroupHelp

**NOTE**: there are no public API for group help, neither the Libre one is full. So we might just send a message using the bot as a command to groupHelp to do whatever we want. And maybe this message is in the private between the two bots.

- [ ]  Command GroupHelp: Send messages as commands from the bot to GroupHelp for desired actions.
- [ ]  Use private messaging: Communicate with GroupHelp in private chats to execute bot commands.

### Leaderboard

- [ ]  Create leaderboard: Develop a customizable leaderboard structure.
- [ ]  Add main leaderboard: Set up the primary leaderboard based on user points.
- [ ]  Display leaderboard: Implement a command to show the leaderboard with the top 10 users.

### Additional Commands

- [ ]  Reset points: Enable admins to reset points for specific users or all users.
- [ ]  Export profiles: Create a command for admins to export user profiles to a file.
- [ ]  Import profiles: Allow importing profiles into the database for batch updates.
- [ ]  Send private warnings: Enable admins to privately warn users about inappropriate behavior.
- [ ]  Notify promotions: Notify users via private messages when they are promoted to admin.
- [ ]  Archive leaderboard: Periodically save leaderboards for historical tracking.

## Handling Errors

- Handle: GrammyError: Call to 'sendMessage' failed! (429: Too Many Requests: retry after 5)
    - to fire this problem, you need to run the bot, stop it, send 5 to 10 message, run it again.

# Feature Goals

  - [ ] Manually/ Move all implementations in GroupHelp to the bot (for better data and feature control)
