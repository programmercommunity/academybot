# Please Read Before Contributing

To work on this bot, please first make a bot on @BotFather. Copy `.env.example` and add your bot_token.

**NOTE**: The bot should be built on telegram BUT NOT depended on it, so any code update might possible make bugs at the future will not be accepted. But, adding features that power telegram ONLY is okay. For instance, making the database using telegram user_id as the primary key will cause a lot of problems if we moved to discord.
